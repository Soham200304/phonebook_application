# 📱 Phonebook Application (DSA-Based)

A **Flutter-based Phonebook mobile application** developed as a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project**.  
The application demonstrates how core DSA concepts such as **lists, sorting, searching, and CRUD operations** can be applied to a real-world mobile application.

The project focuses on clean separation of **UI**, **logic**, and **data layers**, along with modern development practices like **Firebase integration** and **CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Managing contacts efficiently requires proper data organization and fast operations.  
This Phonebook Application allows users to:

- Add new contacts
- View all saved contacts
- Search contacts by name or phone number
- Sort contacts alphabetically (ascending & descending)
- Update contact details
- Delete contacts using swipe gestures
- Store data persistently using Firebase Firestore

The project emphasizes **DSA logic implementation** behind these operations while providing a user-friendly mobile interface.

## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used

- **List (Dynamic Array)** for storing contacts
- **Sorting Algorithms** for alphabetical ordering of contacts
- **Searching Algorithm** for real-time contact search
- **CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Efficient state updates using notifier-based architecture

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **State Management**: ValueNotifier
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Platform**: Android
